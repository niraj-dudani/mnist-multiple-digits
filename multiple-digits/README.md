# mnist-multiple-digits

Toy problem: Detect multiple handwritten consecutive digits from an image.

Approach:
 - Use image processing to segment input image into images of digits
 - Use model trained on MNIST data to detect the digits

Most of the effort here is to process the original image to match what the MNIST data looks like.

Presently, the aim of this project is to set up the pipeline, rather than do the ML well.
